To use the code you must include your email.json file in the cloned repo on your local machine, and create a file called secrets.py that includes the following line of code: "key = API_KEY_FROM_PLOTLY" also change py.sign_in('gwulf', key) from plotly_script.py to have your personal plotly username.

First run count_words.py to create jsons with your data in the results directory, then you can either run plot.py (for matplotlib png files in the plots directory or run plotly_script.py to get (much niceer looking) scatterplots on your plotly account.

Also feel free to rm -rf * from inside the plots and results directories to remove Gideon's Data.
